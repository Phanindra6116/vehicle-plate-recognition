# ðŸš€ License Plate Recognition Dataset

This repository provides a **curated image dataset** designed for building and evaluating **License Plate Recognition (LPR)** systems. It can be used for **computer vision** and **deep learning** tasks such as:

* ðŸš— **Vehicle Detection** â€“ identifying vehicles in diverse environments
* ðŸ”² **License Plate Localization** â€“ detecting license plate regions
* ðŸ”¢ **Optical Character Recognition (OCR)** â€“ extracting alphanumeric text
* ðŸ¤– **Model Training & Benchmarking** â€“ with TensorFlow, PyTorch, YOLO, etc.
